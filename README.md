Exploration of SQLAlchemy and Flask Tools

In this repository, Python and SQLAlchemy are used to perform basic analysis of climate data and Flask is used to create a basic API. 

The climate.ipynb file includes script analyzing precipitation and weather station data accessed from a sqlite database. Below are two graphics produced during this analysis.

The app.py file includes script that designs a Flask API using specific queries. These queries allow users to call precipitation, temperature, and weather station data.
